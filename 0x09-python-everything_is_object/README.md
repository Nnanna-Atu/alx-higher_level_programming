# Python - Everything is Object

## Overview

This project aims to deepen your understanding of Python's object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, specifically focusing on the idea that "everything is an object." The tasks involve exploring Python's treatment of different types of objects, understanding aliasing, immutability, mutation, and other related concepts.

## Project Structure

- **Python Scripts:** All Python scripts will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5. Ensure that your scripts follow the specified guidelines:
  - Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
  - All files must end with a newline character
  - The first line should be `#!/usr/bin/python3`
  - Use pycodestyle (version 2.8.*) for code styling
  - All files must be executable

- **.txt Answer Files:** Each answer file should contain only one line, without a shebang, and ending with a newline character.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand why Python programming is considered awesome.
- Define what an object is in Python.
- Differentiate between a class and an object or instance.
- Distinguish between immutable and mutable objects.
- Explain the concepts of reference, assignment, and aliasing.
- Identify when two variables are identical or linked to the same object.
- Display the variable identifier (memory address) in the CPython implementation.
- Recognize mutable and immutable types, both built-in and user-defined.
- Comprehend how Python passes variables to functions.

## Resources

Before diving into the tasks, make sure to read or watch the following resources:

- [Objects and values](<link to the resource>)
- [Aliasing](<link to the resource>)
- [Immutable vs mutable types](<link to the resource>)
- [Mutation (Only this chapter)](<link to the resource>)
- [Cloning lists](<link to the resource>)
- [Python tuples: immutable but potentially changing](<link to the resource>)

## Tasks

The project tasks involve answering specific questions related to Python's object-oriented nature. Each answer should be a single line in a .txt file. Remember to follow the guidelines and avoid plagiarism.

## Copyright - Plagiarism

Ensure that you refrain from any form of plagiarism, as it is strictly forbidden and may result in removal from the program. The solutions to the tasks should be your original work.

## Conclusion

By completing this project, you will enhance your understanding of Python's object-oriented concepts, preparing you for interviews and strengthening your overall Python programming skills.

Best of luck with your exploration of Python's object world!
