Python - Classes and Objects,This ongoing second chance project focuses on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. The project aims to deepen your understanding of OOP concepts, including classes, objects, attributes, and methods. By completing the tasks outlined below, you will gain practical experience in implementing OOP principles in Python.,"1. Why Python programming is awesome.
2. What is OOP and the concept of "first-class everything."
3. Understanding classes, objects, and instances.
4. Differentiating between a class and an object or instance.
5. Working with attributes and understanding public, protected, and private attributes.
6. The significance of `self` in Python classes.
7. Defining and using methods, especially the special `__init__` method.
8. Understanding Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding.
9. Exploring properties and their role in Python classes.
10. Distinguishing between attributes and properties.
11. Adhering to the Pythonic way of writing getters and setters.
12. Dynamically creating arbitrary new attributes for existing instances.
13. Binding attributes to objects and classes.
14. Exploring the `__dict__` of a class and/or instance and its contents.
15. How Python finds the attributes of an object or class.
16. Utilizing the `getattr` function effectively.",To successfully complete this project, make sure to read or watch the recommended resources:
