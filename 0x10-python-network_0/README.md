### Project: Python - Network #0

#### Description:
This project focuses on understanding the fundamentals of networking, particularly HTTP, URLs, HTTP requests, and responses. It covers essential concepts such as URL structure, HTTP methods, status codes, headers, cookies, and making requests using cURL.

#### Learning Objectives:
At the end of this project, learners should be able to:

- Define a URL and HTTP
- Read and interpret a URL
- Understand the components of a URL, including the scheme, domain name, sub-domain, port number, and query string
- Explain HTTP requests and responses, including headers and message bodies
- Describe HTTP request methods and response status codes
- Understand HTTP Cookies and their usage
- Make HTTP requests using cURL
- Explain the process of typing a URL in a browser and what happens at the application level

### Requirements:

#### General:
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All scripts should be exactly 3 lines long
- All files should end with a new line
- All files must be executable
- All Bash scripts should start with `#!/bin/bash` and have a comment explaining their purpose
- All curl commands must have the option `-s` (silent mode)
- All Python files should start with `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Use pycodestyle (version 2.8.*) for Python code style
- Document all modules, classes, and functions
- Ensure documentation provides clear explanations of the purpose of each module, class, and method

| Topic                            | Description                                                                                                     |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| What a URL is                    | URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator and is used to specify the address of a resource on the internet.       |
| What HTTP is                     | HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol and is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web.  |
| How to read a URL                | A URL consists of several components including the scheme, domain name, path, query string, and fragment.       |
| The scheme for a HTTP URL        | The scheme specifies the protocol used to access the resource, such as `http` or `https`.                        |
| What a domain name is            | A domain name is the human-readable address used to access a website, such as `example.com`.                    |
| What a sub-domain is             | A sub-domain is a subdivision of a domain, allowing for further organization of web resources.                  |
| How to define a port number      | A port number is defined in a URL using the syntax `:port`, where `port` is the number used for communication.  |
| What a query string is           | A query string is a part of a URL that contains data to be passed to the server as key-value pairs.             |
| What an HTTP request is          | An HTTP request is a message sent by a client to a server, specifying the desired action to be performed.       |
| What an HTTP response is         | An HTTP response is a message sent by a server to a client, containing the requested resource or status code.   |
| What HTTP headers are            | HTTP headers provide additional information about the request or response, such as content type or cookies.     |
| What the HTTP message body is    | The HTTP message body contains the data being sent with the request or response.                                |
| What an HTTP request method is   | An HTTP request method defines the action to be performed on a resource, such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.   |
| What an HTTP response status code| An HTTP response status code indicates the outcome of the request, such as success, redirection, or error.      |
| What an HTTP Cookie is           | An HTTP Cookie is a small piece of data sent from a website and stored on the user's computer by the browser.   |
| How to make a request with cURL  | cURL is a command-line tool used to transfer data to or from a server using various protocols, including HTTP.  |
| What happens when you type google.com in your browser (Application level) | When you type google.com in your browser, it initiates a DNS lookup to resolve the domain name to an IP address. Then, an HTTP request is made to the server to fetch the requested resource (in this case, the Google homepage), and the response is rendered in the browser window. |
