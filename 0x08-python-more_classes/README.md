# Python - More Classes and Objects README

## Overview

This project focuses on enhancing your understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. Below are the key topics covered and the corresponding learning objectives.

## Learning Objectives

| Topic | Example |
|-------|---------|
| **Why Python programming is awesome** | Python's readability and simplicity make it easy for beginners and professionals alike. |
| **What is OOP** | OOP is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to structure code. |
| **"First-class everything"** | In Python, everything is an object, and functions are first-class citizens. |
| **What is a class** | Defining a simple class named `Person` with attributes like `name` and `age`. |
| **What is an object and an instance** | Creating instances of the `Person` class, like `person1 = Person("Alice", 25)`. |
| **Difference between a class and an object or instance** | The class is a blueprint, while an object is an instance of that blueprint. |
| **What is an attribute** | Adding attributes like `height` and `weight` to the `Person` class. |
| **How to use public, protected, and private attributes** | Demonstrating the usage of `_protected` and `__private` attributes. |
| **What is `self`** | Understanding the significance of `self` in Python class methods. |
| **What is a method** | Creating methods like `calculate_bmi` within the `Person` class. |
| **The special `__init__` method and how to use it** | Using `__init__` to initialize attributes during object creation. |
| **Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding** | Applying data encapsulation by using private attributes. |
| **What is a property** | Defining a property like `full_name` that combines `name` and `last_name`. |
| **Difference between an attribute and a property in Python** | Highlighting the distinction between a regular attribute and a property. |
| **Pythonic way to write getters and setters in Python** | Implementing getter and setter methods for specific attributes. |
| **Special `__str__` and `__repr__` methods and how to use them** | Customizing the string representation of an object using `__str__`. |
| **Difference between `__str__` and `__repr__`** | Explaining when to use each method based on their intended purposes. |
| **Class attribute** | Creating a class attribute like `species` for a `Pet` class. |
| **Difference between an object attribute and a class attribute** | Illustrating how object attributes differ from class attributes. |
| **Class method** | Defining a class method to create objects based on specific conditions. |
| **Static method** | Implementing a static method for general utility within the class. |
| **Dynamically create arbitrary new attributes for existing instances** | Adding a method to dynamically add new features to a `Car` instance. |
| **Bind attributes to object and classes** | Showing how to bind a function as an attribute to a class. |
| **`__dict__` of a class and of an instance of a class** | Inspecting the `__dict__` attribute to view class and instance attributes. |
| **How does Python find the attributes of an object or class** | Understanding attribute lookup and inheritance in Python. |
| **How to use the `getattr` function** | Retrieving the value of a dynamic attribute using `getattr`. |
