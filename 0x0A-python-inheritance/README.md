# Python Inheritance Project

## Overview
This Python project focuses on understanding and implementing inheritance in object-oriented programming. The project is part of the curriculum designed by Guillaume, aiming to enhance your Python programming skills and comprehension of inheritance concepts.

## Project Details
- **Author:** Guillaume
- **Weight:** 1
- **Project Duration:** Jan 8, 2024, 6:00 AM - Jan 9, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **Checker Release:** Jan 8, 2024, 12:00 PM
- **Auto Review:** Will be launched at the deadline

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Explain why Python programming is awesome
- Understand the concepts of superclass, base class, or parent class
- Define a subclass
- List attributes and methods of a class or instance
- Inherit a class from another
- Define a class with multiple base classes
- Override a method or attribute inherited from the base class
- Utilize isinstance, issubclass, type, and super built-in functions
- Comprehend the default class every class inherits from
- Understand the purpose of inheritance

## Requirements
### Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Interpreter: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All files end with a new line
- First line: `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Mandatory README.md file at the root of the project folder
- Code should use pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- All files must be executable

### Python Test Cases
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All test files inside a 'tests' folder with .txt extension
- Execute tests using: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
- Modules, classes, and functions should have documentation
- Encouraged collaboration on test cases to cover edge cases

### Documentation
- No usage of 'import' or 'from' inside comments
- Module, class, and method documentation required
- Documentation should be real sentences explaining the purpose

## Copyright & Plagiarism
