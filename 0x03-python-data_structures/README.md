# 0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

## Overview

This project focuses on Python programming and the fundamentals of data structures, specifically lists and tuples. It covers various tasks to strengthen your understanding of these data structures and their manipulation in Python.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you should be able to:

- Understand the basics of Python programming.
- Learn how to work with lists and tuples in Python.
- Differentiate between strings and lists.
- Utilize common list methods.
- Use lists as stacks and queues.
- Implement list comprehensions.
- Grasp the concept of tuples and when to use them.
- Understand sequences, tuple packing, and sequence unpacking.
- Master the `del` statement and its application.

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python3 (version 3.8.5)
- Files must end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- Code should adhere to the Pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- All files must be executable
- The length of files will be tested using `wc`

### C

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python3 (version 3.8.5)
- Files must end with a new line
- Code should use the Betty style (checked with `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`)
- No global variables allowed
- No more than 5 functions per file
- Prototypes of all functions should be included in a header file called `lists.h`
- Don't forget to push your header file
- All header files should be include guarded

## Tasks

### 0. Print a list of integers
- Write a function that prints all integers of a list.
- Prototype: `def print_list_integer(my_list=[]):`
- Format: One integer per line.

Example:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print_list_integer(my_list)
