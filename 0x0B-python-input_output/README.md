# Python Input/Output Project

## Overview
This Python project, curated by Guillaume, is designed to enhance your understanding of file input/output operations in Python. The focus is on reading and writing files, handling file cursor movements, and working with JSON serialization and deserialization.

## Project Details
- **Author:** Guillaume
- **Weight:** 1
- **Project Duration:** Jan 9, 2024, 6:00 AM - Jan 10, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **Checker Release:** Jan 9, 2024, 12:00 PM
- **Auto Review:** Will be launched at the deadline

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Understand the significance of Python programming
- Open and write text in a file
- Read the full content of a file and iterate through it line by line
- Manipulate the cursor within a file
- Ensure proper file closure after usage
- Utilize the `with` statement for file handling
- Grasp the concepts of JSON, serialization, and deserialization
- Convert Python data structures to JSON strings and vice versa

## Requirements
### Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Interpreter: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All files end with a new line
- First line: `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Mandatory README.md file at the root of the project folder
- Code should use pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- All files must be executable

### Python Test Cases
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All test files inside a 'tests' folder with .txt extension
- Execute tests using: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
- Modules, classes, and functions should have documentation
- Encouraged collaboration on test cases to cover various scenarios

### Documentation
- No usage of 'import' or 'from' inside comments
- Module, class, and method documentation required
- Documentation should be real sentences explaining the purpose

## Copyright & Plagiarism
- Do not copy and paste someone elseâ€™s work
- No publication of project content
- Strictly forbid plagiarism, leading to removal from the program
