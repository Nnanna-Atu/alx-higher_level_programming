- Execute JavaScript scripts.
- Create and manage variables and constants effectively.
- Differentiate between var, const, and let.
- Identify and utilize various data types available in JavaScript.
- Implement conditional statements (if, if...else).
- Utilize comments for code documentation.
- Assign values to variables and manipulate them.
- Implement iterative structures like while and for loops.
- Control loop execution with break and continue statements.
- Define functions and understand their usage.
- Recognize the scope of variables in JavaScript.
- Apply arithmetic operators to perform mathematical operations.
- Manipulate objects and arrays (dictionaries).
